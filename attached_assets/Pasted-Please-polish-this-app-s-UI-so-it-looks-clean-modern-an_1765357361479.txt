Please polish this app’s UI so it looks clean, modern, and market-ready, without changing any existing functionality or breaking navigation.

Focus on visual design and UX only:

1. Overall Theme & Layout

Create a cohesive visual style that fits a friendly cooking/recipe brand (like “CookMate”).

Use a light, warm color palette with 1 primary accent color and 1 secondary accent color.

Choose 1–2 modern, readable fonts and apply consistent font sizes, weights, and hierarchy for headings, body text, and buttons.

Add generous spacing, padding, and alignment so everything feels airy and intentional.

Make sure the layout is fully responsive on desktop and mobile.

2. Navigation & Header

Add a simple top navigation bar with the app logo/name and links/tabs for: My Pantry, Recipes, and My Cookbook.

Keep the nav sticky on scroll on desktop if it makes sense.

3. Recipe Cards & Lists

Redesign recipe cards to look clean and professional: clear image area, title, short description, time, difficulty pill/badge, and “View Recipe” button.

Add subtle hover states on cards and buttons (slight shadow, scale, or border change).

Make sure text never overlaps and is easily readable on all screen sizes.

4. Detail Views & Forms

For the recipe detail page, clearly separate sections: title, metadata (time + difficulty), ingredients list, and numbered steps.

For the “Add New Recipe” form in My Cookbook, style the inputs and labels so they are easy to scan and use. Group related fields and align everything neatly.

Make primary actions (like Save Recipe, Add to Cookbook, Find Recipes) visually prominent.

5. My Pantry & My Cookbook Pages

Style the ingredient input and list so it feels simple and approachable for beginners.

In My Cookbook, present saved recipes in the same polished card style as the main recipe list, with consistent spacing and alignment.

6. Accessibility & Polish

Ensure good color contrast for text and buttons.

Use consistent border-radius, shadows, and button styles across the app.

Add basic focus styles for keyboard navigation.

Please keep the overall structure of the components and routes the same so nothing breaks; just refactor the CSS/styling, layout, and small UI elements to match this vision. When you’re done, explain briefly which main files you updated for styling.
